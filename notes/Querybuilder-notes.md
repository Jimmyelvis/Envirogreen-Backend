I'm glad to hear that the adjustments worked for including the `blog_posts_count` in your response. Regarding the issue you're experiencing with the `makeHidden` method causing a crash when uncommented, I can help you understand why this is happening and how to fix it.

---

## **Understanding the Issue**

Your current function is:

```php
public function GetBlogPostAuthors()
{
    $authors = User::whereHas('blogPosts')
        ->withCount('blogPosts')
        ->with('role', 'photoStaff')
        ->addSelect('id', 'name', 'email', 'role_id', 'photoStaff_id')
        // ->makeHidden('updated_at', 'created_at', 'email_verified_at', 'password', 'remember_token')
        ->get();

    return response()->json([
        'message' => 'success',
        'count' => $authors->count(),
        'authors' => $authors
    ]);
}
```

**Problem:** When you uncomment `->makeHidden(...)`, the function crashes.

**Observation:** The `makeHidden` method is being called **before** the `->get()` method.

---

## **Root Cause**

The `makeHidden` method is a method available on **Eloquent Model instances** or **Eloquent Collections** (which are collections of model instances). It is **not** a method available on the **Query Builder** instance.

- **Eloquent Model / Collection Methods:** Methods like `makeHidden`, `setAttribute`, `toArray`, etc., are available on model instances or collections of models.
- **Query Builder Methods:** Methods like `where`, `with`, `select`, `get`, etc., are available on the query builder, which builds the database query.

When you call `->makeHidden()` before `->get()`, you're attempting to call a model method on the query builder, which doesn't have that method, leading to a crash.

---

## **Solution**

### **Call `makeHidden()` After `->get()`**

To fix the issue, you need to call `makeHidden()` **after** you've executed the query and retrieved the results with `->get()`. This way, you're calling `makeHidden()` on the **Eloquent Collection** of models.

**Corrected Function:**

```php
public function GetBlogPostAuthors()
{
    $authors = User::whereHas('blogPosts')
        ->withCount('blogPosts')
        ->with('role', 'photoStaff')
        ->addSelect('id', 'name', 'email', 'role_id', 'photoStaff_id')
        ->get()
        ->makeHidden(['updated_at', 'created_at', 'email_verified_at', 'password', 'remember_token']);

    return response()->json([
        'message' => 'success',
        'count' => $authors->count(),
        'authors' => $authors
    ]);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **`->get()`**: Executes the query and returns an Eloquent Collection of User models.
- **`->makeHidden([...])`**: Called on the collection, it hides the specified attributes from all models in the collection.

---

## **Additional Details**

### **Why Does This Work?**

- **Eloquent Collection:** After `->get()`, `$authors` is an instance of `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection`, which contains User model instances.
- **`makeHidden` on Collection:** When `makeHidden` is called on a collection, it applies to all models within that collection.
- **Attributes to Hide:** The attributes you specified (`updated_at`, `created_at`, etc.) will be hidden from serialization (e.g., when converting to JSON).

### **What Happens When You Call `makeHidden` Before `->get()`?**

- **Before `->get()`:** You're still building the query; you have a `Builder` instance.
- **No `makeHidden` Method:** The `Builder` class does not have a `makeHidden` method, so attempting to call it results in a **`BadMethodCallException`** or similar error.
- **Crash:** The application crashes because it's trying to call a method that doesn't exist on the query builder.

---

## **Alternative Approaches**

### **1. Use `setHidden` on the Model**

If you want to hide certain attributes for all instances of a model, you can set the `$hidden` property in the model class.

**In the User Model (`User.php`):**

```php
class User extends Authenticatable
{
    // ... existing code ...

    protected $hidden = [
        'password',
        'remember_token',
        'updated_at',
        'created_at',
        'email_verified_at',
    ];

    // ... existing code ...
}
```

**Advantages:**

- **Automatic Hiding:** These attributes will always be hidden whenever a User model is serialized to JSON.
- **No Need for `makeHidden`:** You don't need to call `makeHidden` in your queries.

### **2. Use API Resources**

For more control over your JSON responses, consider using Laravel's API Resources.

**Create a User Resource:**

```php
php artisan make:resource UserResource
```

**In `UserResource.php`:**

```php
namespace App\Http\Resources;

use Illuminate\Http\Resources\Json\JsonResource;

class UserResource extends JsonResource
{
    public function toArray($request)
    {
        return [
            'id' => $this->id,
            'name' => $this->name,
            'email' => $this->email,
            'blog_posts_count' => $this->blog_posts_count,
            'role' => new RoleResource($this->whenLoaded('role')),
            'photo_staff' => new PhotoStaffResource($this->whenLoaded('photoStaff')),
            // Add other fields as needed
        ];
    }
}
```

**In Your Controller:**

```php
public function GetBlogPostAuthors()
{
    $authors = User::whereHas('blogPosts')
        ->withCount('blogPosts')
        ->with('role', 'photoStaff')
        ->addSelect('id', 'name', 'email', 'role_id', 'photoStaff_id')
        ->get();

    return response()->json([
        'message' => 'success',
        'count' => $authors->count(),
        'authors' => UserResource::collection($authors)
    ]);
}
```

**Advantages:**

- **Full Control:** You can specify exactly which fields to include or exclude.
- **Nested Resources:** Handle relationships elegantly with nested resources.
- **Reusability:** Resources can be reused across different endpoints.

---

## **Conclusion**

- **Issue:** Calling `makeHidden` before `->get()` causes a crash because `makeHidden` is not a method on the query builder.
- **Solution:** Call `makeHidden` **after** `->get()`, so it's called on the Eloquent Collection.
- **Additional Options:** Use the `$hidden` property in the model or API Resources for more control.

## **Final Adjusted Function**

```php
public function GetBlogPostAuthors()
{
    $authors = User::whereHas('blogPosts')
        ->withCount('blogPosts')
        ->with('role', 'photoStaff')
        ->addSelect('id', 'name', 'email', 'role_id', 'photoStaff_id')
        ->get()
        ->makeHidden(['updated_at', 'created_at', 'email_verified_at', 'password', 'remember_token']);

    return response()->json([
        'message' => 'success',
        'count' => $authors->count(),
        'authors' => $authors
    ]);
}
```

---

**Now, your function should work as expected without crashing when `makeHidden` is included.**
